Pacakge is a collection  of Source code 
in details package is container of classes, interfaces and enum

Packages are used to separate our source code based on the business requirement

 consider an application have many components ,so instead of grouping all components into a particular folder we can divide our components as are per the business requirement into separate package

like 
   model package---which holds plain clasess to provide the data
   service package ---which can hold an interface to provide operation
   dao package---which hold classes to implement business specific services
   controller package--which provide all classes to accept request from client, process those request by communicating with other components

So package is used to split our source code into separate layers
 using package developer can maintain their source code

There are two types of packages
like
Predefined package and user defined package

1.Predifiend packages are already defined inside java library
like,

i) java.lang ---A.It is default package in java
                B.It holds all necessarey reserved keywords
                C.It holds Object class, String class, StringBuffer,StringBuilder class, Thread class, Exception class, System 

ii.java.util package---A.It holds all utility classes like
                        Scanner class, Date class , Calendar class,
                         Random class
                     B. It holds entire collection framework and Map interface and its classes
                     C.from jdk1.8 onwards, java.util package included with lots of components and API like,Stream API,Optional classes

iii.java.io package---A.it holds all abstract classes, concreate classes to read and write character and binary data from file and to file 
                      B.It provides important classes like
                        OutputStream ,FileOutputStream,ObjectOuputStream,InputStream,FileInputStream, ObjectInputStream,Reader, Writer FileWriter, FileReader, BufferedReader,BufferedWriter.

iv.java.time package---A.It holds all necessary classes like,
                 LocalDate, LocalTime classes to manipulate with date and time

v.java.sql package--A.It holds all necessary classes and interfaces
to communicate with database.
                 B.It holds entire JDBC api(Application Programming Interface)
                c.It holds classes and interfaces  like,
                     Connection interface, Statement interface, DriverManager class, PreparedStatement interface, ResultSet interface , Callable interface e.t.c
vi.java.net--A.To communicate with different machine it provides all important classes and interfaces 
      like IpAddrees, Socket

vii.java.awt and java.swing package---It provides all classes and interfaces to implement GUI(Graphical User interface in java)


to use perdefined packages we use import keyword

to create out user defined packages we use package keyword

As per the java namming conention package name should  be declared in lowercase.
