   1.Write a program to find if the number entered is positive or negative.

    Example1:

     C:\>java Sample 10 

     O/P Expected : 10 is a positive number

    Example2:
    C:\>java Sample -10 

     O/P Expected : -10 is a negative number

   Example3:
    C:\>java Sample 0 

     O/P Expected : 0 is neither negative or positive

3.Write a program to calculate the fuel consumption of your vehicle.
The program should ask the user to enter the quantity of petrol to fill up the tank and the distance covered till the tank goes dry.
Calculate the fuel consumption and display it in the format (liters per 100 kilometers).
Convert the same result to the U.S. style of miles per gallon and display the result. If the quantity or distance is zero or negative display "<respective_input> is an Invalid Input".
[Note: The US approach of fuel consumption calculation (distance / fuel) is the inverse of the European approach (fuel / distance ). Also note that 1 kilometer is 0.6214 miles, and 1 liter is 0.2642 gallons.]
The result should be with two decimal place.
To get two decimal place refer the below-mentioned print statement :
float cost=670.23;
System.out.printf("You need a sum of Rs.%.2f to cover the trip",cost);

Sample Input 1:

Enter the no of liters to fill the tank
20
Enter the distance covered
150
Sample Output 1:
Liters/100KM
13.33
Miles/gallons
17.64

Explanation: 
For 150 KM fuel consumption is 20 liters, 
Then for 100 KM fuel consumption would be (20/150)*100=13.33,
Distance is given in KM, we have to convert it to miles (150*0.6214)=93.21,
Fuel consumption is given in liters, we have to convert it to gallons (20*0.2642)=5.284, 
Then find (miles/gallons)=(93.21/5.284)=17.64

Sample Input 2:
Enter the no of liters to fill the tank
-5
Sample Output 2:
-5 is an Invalid Input

Sample Input 3:

Enter the no of liters to fill the tank
25
Enter the distance covered
-21
Sample Output 3:
-21 is an Invalid Input



4. write a java program which will print the year name in word as per the given input between 1 to 12

Sample input 1

output: January



5.if the percentage is above 90, assign grade A
if the percentage is above 75, assign grade B
if the percentage is above 65, assign grade C


6. define one method

 static boolean getLogin(int id, long phone)
{
id=123;
phone=8147117572L

}

if parameterized id will match with the value of local variable and phone number then , getLogin()  method will return true or false



7. static String addGraceMarks(int marks)

//the above method will take input from command line

//if the marks is >35 and <=30 then add 5 marks will be added the given marks

//print "Your new marks is 32

 else  

print "you are not eligible to add grace marks
